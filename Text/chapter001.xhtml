        <p class="noindent">Skel and Po lie sprawled out across their desks.</p>

        <p>“It’s over.”</p>

        <p>“It’s finally over…”</p>

        <p>
          The three of us just finished up our Midgar Academy final written
          exams.
        </p>

        <p>
          “You guys wanna go over the answer sheet and see how we did?” I ask.
        </p>

        <p>
          Losing Isaac was a major blow, but I managed to pull through by
          cheating off the crib sheet I got from Nina. I’m actually pretty proud
          of how I did. I tailored my scores for each topic so I would just
          barely avoid failing in each of them.
        </p>

        <p>“Are you outta your mind?” Skel replies.</p>

        <p>
          “It’s not like we can change our scores now,” agrees Po. “Besides, the
          practical exams are next week.”
        </p>

        <p>“Yeah, fair,” I admit.</p>

        <p>
          I was pretty sure there was no way in hell they would be interested.
          That was the whole reason I asked. Thank goodness they weren’t, or
          that could’ve backfired badly.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s been about a month since the terrorist attack with the white fog,
          putting us about halfway through the second month of the year. Things
          got kind of hectic when the Knight Order came in and did their
          investigation, but things at the academy have settled down since then.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, it’s awesome how many terrorist attacks this fantasy world has.
          Back in my old world, all I got to do was occasionally hunt down
          hoodlums.
        </p>

        <p><a id="page-6"></a>Oh, and Claire’s been in a coma ever since.</p>

        <p>
          I’m honestly not that torn up about it, and I’ve certainly been
          enjoying my newfound freedom. Zeta says she’ll wake up sooner or
          later, so I’m sure she’s probably fine. It might affect her
          job-hunting prospects, though.
        </p>

        <p>
          Actually, wait a minute. She never took her final exams. Please tell
          me they’re not gonna hold her back a year. The sooner she graduates
          and gets out of my hair, the better.
        </p>

        <p>
          “So what do you guys want to do?” I ask. “We could study for the
          practical exam—”
        </p>

        <p>“Are you outta your mind?” Skel replies.</p>

        <p>
          “Now that we’re done with the written test, we’re free to screw around
          as much as we want until the practical exam comes up,” agrees Po.
        </p>

        <p>“Yeah, fair.”</p>

        <p>
          “And if you think you can just take our money and run, then you’ve got
          another one coming. We’ve got fat bankrolls, and we’re coming for
          you.”
        </p>

        <p>
          “We have the power of Mitsugoshi Installment Payments on our side!”
        </p>

        <p>
          Skel gives me a seedy grin as he flashes me a stack of bills, and Po
          starts shuffling a deck of cards.
        </p>

        <p>“Now, onward to our battlefield!” Skel cries.</p>

        <p>“I assume you mean my room, right?”</p>

        <p>
          “You should go ahead and take a shower first,” Po says. “We’re not
          letting you sleep a wink tonight.”
        </p>

        <p>“I shower in the mornings like a normal person.”</p>

        <p>They carefully pin me in from both sides.</p>

        <p>
          Then I hear Christina’s voice. “I’m sorry, Kanade. This is all my
          fault.”
        </p>

        <p>
          “Oh no… What am I going to do?” The girl standing across from her
          looks oddly familiar. “I can’t believe Miss Eliza is going to walk
          away scot-free…”
        </p>

        <p>Tears run down the girl’s face.</p>

        <p>Oh, now I remember. She’s the one we saved back in the fog.</p>

        <p>“C’mon, let’s do this thing,” Skel urges me.</p>

        <p>
          <a id="page-7"></a>“Don’t go getting cold feet on us, now,” Po says.
        </p>

        <p>“All right, all right, I’m coming.”</p>

        <p>
          As I leave the classroom, there’s just one thought on my mind: Being a
          major noble must be sweet. They can get away with anything.

          “There’s always something so hollow about total victory,” I mutter to
          myself as I lie on my bed of money.
        </p>

        <p>
          Skel and Po bailed before the clock even hit midnight. Midway through
          the game, I started cleaning them out with mechanical efficiency, and
          my winnings gradually piled higher and higher.
        </p>

        <p>Once the passion fades, all that remains is boundless emptiness…</p>

        <p>“Heh-heh-heh… I sounded like a real high roller there.”</p>

        <p>
          I get up from my bed and start gathering up the stacks of bills I
          spread across it for the bit. All told, we’re looking at two million
          <em>zeni</em>. Thanks, Skel and Po. And thanks, Mitsugoshi Installment
          Payments.
        </p>

        <p>
          “So this is the limited-edition deck Mitsugoshi put out, huh? I hear
          these are wicked expensive…but it’s also kinda creepy.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The theme of the design is “horror.” I should probably just sell it.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s still too early to go to sleep, so I guess I’ll get some training
          in.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right as I start working my magic, though, I spot a gleaming card that
          has fallen by the side of my bed.
        </p>

        <p>“Huh, what’s that?”</p>

        <p>
          The card is gold and shiny and looks super fancy. The front says
          <em>“Royal Mitsugoshi Deluxe Bar Membership Card”</em> in beautiful
          lettering, and the back says <em>“Member #001, Cid Kagenou.”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          “Oh, right. Mitsugoshi was opening a fancy members-only bar, and Gamma
          gave me a membership card.”
        </p>

        <p>
          I completely ignored it because I assumed they were gonna use the
          knowledge they stole from me to rip off everyone who went there.
        </p>

        <p>“A fancy bar, huh…?”</p>

        <p>
          <a id="page-8"></a>I snatch a glance at my fat bankroll. I
          <em>do</em> have a soft spot for those scenes you occasionally see in
          spy movies where people have a secret conversation in a quiet bar.
        </p>

        <p>
          “And hey, maybe I can get them to give me a friends-and-family
          discount.”
        </p>

        <p>Worst-case scenario, I can always dine and dash.</p>

        <p>All right, let’s do this.</p>

        <p>
          If you’re gonna do spy stuff, you gotta do it in a suit. The one I
          wore as John Smith is in tatters, so I decide to wear the
          Mitsugoshi-brand suit I got from Alpha.
        </p>

        <p>
          After polishing my shoes and giving my hair a slight part down the
          middle, I head out for my nighttime jaunt through the capital.
        </p>

        <div class="ext_ch">
          <div class="decoration-rw10">
            <div
              class="media-rw image-rw float-none-rw floatgalley-none-rw align-center-rw width-fixed-rw exclude-print-rw"
            >
              <div class="pc-rw">
                <img alt="" class="orn" src="../Images/Art_sborn.jpg" />
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="space-break">“I think this is the place…”</p>

        <p>
          To my surprise, I find the fancy bar underground just off a tiny
          alleyway. Its door is unobtrusive and features the Mitsugoshi logo and
          a delicate engraving. I guess this place is going for a “secret
          hideout” kind of vibe.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m a little bit nervous as I open the door and head in. The room is
          quiet. The whole place is indirectly lit, and the array of dim pendant
          lights above the bar counter makes it look like a glowing sea of
          stars. The floor is made of wolfking stone, and it looks like each
          table is made of a single plank of Yggdrasil wood. We’re talking
          hundreds of millions of <em>zeni</em> worth of stuff, and that’s just
          at a glance. A shiver runs up my spine as I calculate the risk and
          returns of looting the place.
        </p>

        <p>“Good evening, sir.”</p>

        <p>
          “Oh, uh, hi.” My reply comes out dumber than I intend, possibly
          because I was thinking about something unscrupulous. “I’ve got my
          membership card right here.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <a id="page-9"></a>I reach into my pocket to pull out the shiny golden
          card, but the hostess shakes her head. “I assure you that won’t be
          necessary, Mr. Cid Kagenou. Welcome to our humble establishment. We
          have a VIP room in the back, if you’d be interested…”
        </p>

        <p>
          She turns her heterochromatic eyes to the seats over in the corner.
        </p>

        <p>“Nah, I’ll go with the counter.”</p>

        <p>
          It takes me a moment to make up my mind, but if you’re doing spy
          stuff, you gotta sit at the counter.
        </p>

        <p>“Very well. Please follow me.”</p>

        <p>“Sorry, but…have we met somewhere?”</p>

        <p>
          She’d turned away to lead me to my seat, but when I ask the question,
          she looks back at me in surprise. She’s a half-elf with dark hair and
          different-colored eyes: gold and silver.
        </p>

        <p>“We met at Mitsugoshi,” she tells me.</p>

        <p>“Oh, right, you were there with Gamma.”</p>

        <p>
          “I’m honored that you remember me. My name is Omega. Now, your seat is
          right this way.”
        </p>

        <p>
          I follow Omega to the counter and sit down. The bartender looks
          familiar, too. She’s a blond elf with bobbed hair wearing a men’s
          uniform.
        </p>

        <p>“You were there at Mitsugoshi, too, weren’t you?” I ask her.</p>

        <p>“You honor me. My name is Chi.”</p>

        <p>“I’m Cid Kagenou.”</p>

        <p>“Oh, I’m well aware.”</p>

        <p>
          Chi gives me a composed bow, but for some reason, her fingers are
          trembling. Maybe she hasn’t been tending bar for very long or
          something.
        </p>

        <p>
          This <em>is the person you’ve got working at your swanky bar?</em>
        </p>

        <p>“I’ll have…”</p>

        <p>
          I’ve already got my order all picked out. I’m in the mood to reenact
          everyone’s favorite spy movie.
        </p>

        <p>“…a vodka martini.”</p>

        <p>I then drop my voice to a low, resonant bass.</p>

        <p>“Shaken, not stirred.”</p>

        <p>
          At times like these, it’s important to carry yourself like a hardened
          <a id="page-10"></a>badass. I can’t let them find out that this is my
          first time going to a bar like this. Instead, I need to lay on the
          silent pressure like <em>I’m</em> the one testing <em>them</em>.
        </p>

        <p>“One shaken vodka martini, coming right up.”</p>

        <p>
          Chi’s expression is tense, and she takes a deep breath to steady her
          shaking hands.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that I think about it, maybe that shaking is actually part of the
          cocktail-making process. The more I stare at her, the more intense the
          shaking gets.
        </p>

        <p>“I see…,” I mutter.</p>

        <p>
          I dunno much about cocktails, so this is valuable info I’m learning.
          Apparently, the trick to being a good bartender is how badly your
          fingers are shaking.
        </p>

        <p>
          At that point, a question dawns on me. Since when has this world had
          vodka?
        </p>

        <p>“How strange…,” I say.</p>

        <p>Chi freezes.</p>

        <p>
          <em
            >It’s okay, I wasn’t talking about you. I was talking about the fact
            that vodka even exists in this world.</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          The moment I start questioning it, though, I realize that the answer
          is obvious. The girls did this.
        </p>

        <p>
          “I never took you for a vodka martini drinker,” comes a clear,
          beautiful voice from behind me.
        </p>

        <p>I know who it is without even having to turn around.</p>

        <p>“Hello, Alpha.”</p>

        <p>“It’s been too long.”</p>

        <p>“True that.”</p>

        <p>
          She seems a little more grown-up than the last time I saw her. She has
          gorgeous blond hair and blue eyes, and her understated dress matches
          the bar’s ambience perfectly.
        </p>

        <p>“I thought you didn’t care for liquor,” she notes.</p>

        <p>“Did I say that?”</p>

        <p>
          “Not out loud. I just can’t think of a single time I ever saw you
          enjoying a drink.”
